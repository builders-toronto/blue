# Blue Collar Meta (BLUE)

> **Utility‑rewards coin for every real‑world contribution.**

**BLUE** is a TIP‑3 jetton on the **TON** blockchain created by the Renovation.Reviews mega construction‑tech family.  It rewards—and circulates within—any trade, craft, or blue‑collar project, turning verified effort into on‑chain value that can power community incentives, DeFi activity, and the tooling we build next.
