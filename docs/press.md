### Tokenomics at a Glance

| Allocation      | Purpose                                                                    | Status                                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **25 % Burn**   | Permanent reduction of total supply to establish scarcity and enhance long-term value. | Executed on-chain via Jetton burn.                           |
| **50 % Liquidity** | Locked in TON DEX pools to anchor price discovery and guarantee deep, trust-minimised trading. | Deposited and time-locked; viewable on STON.fi.              |
| **25 % Treasury**  | Rewards distribution, community incentives, development and ongoing operations. | Held in a multisig; disbursements governed by on-chain votes. |

*This balanced allocation places half the supply immediately in the market, eliminates one-quarter forever, and reserves the remainder for ecosystem growth.*
