# Introduction

**Blue Collar Meta (BLUE)** is a TIP-3 jetton on TON that rewards *verified real-world contributions* in the Renovation.Reviews ecosystem.  
The core supply is now immutable (admin key revoked), but new smart-contracts extend its utility:

| Module | Purpose | Status |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| Bond-Pledge | Discounted BLUE in exchange for LP tokens & bUSD | In design |
| Staking Farm | Time-weighted staking for fee-sharing and governance | In design |
| Stable-reserve coin (bUSD) | Treasury-backed unit pegged > 1 USDT | Prototype |
| Treasury & ETF | Multi-sig fund, auto-buyback, insurance portfolio | Prototype |

This GitBook details each module, the economics that bind them together, and the roadmap to main-net launch.
